#### Cisco CSR Agreement

We will simulate your on-premises gateway device (VPN concentrator) using a Cisco 1000v. The Cisco CSR 1000v is a Virtual IOS-XE based Enterprise VPN Router that can run on AWS. The CSR 1000v supports the same commands, tools and logs as Cisco ISR and ASR platforms, which can also be used in your datacenter.
